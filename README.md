# YTD_AutonomAI

This Python script allows users to download videos from a YouTube playlist. The script prompts the user to input the YouTube playlist URL and the location where the videos should be saved. It then downloads videos from the playlist starting from the newest additions. Before each download, the script checks for supported codecs (H.264, DV, Motion JPEG A, Motion JPEG B, MPEG-4) and prompts the user for confirmation. After completing the download process, a summary report is displayed showing the total number of videos downloaded and skipped.
